\begin{enumerate}
    \item Overall, modelling will be successful though constrained (likely due to the small size of the corpus).
    \item Due to a lack of syntactic data, mixed effects modelling based on the Nêhiyawêwin corpus will be able to provide some insights, but model fits will rarely exceed an $\rho^{2}$ of 0.2.
    \item Semantic variables will do more to explain variance than morphological variables (as in \citep{arppe2008univariate}).
    \item The Conjunct Type alternation will be significantly less cohesive in its results (due to the straightforward syntactic/semantic choices driving it, which are not reflected in the variables of the data set).
    \item The alternation between the Independent and the ê-Conjunct will be the most robust and well-fit model (because the two forms are nearly synonymous in many cases).
    \item most conjunct in the IvC are e cnj anyways, probalby due to it having more tokens
