Abstract = {This book explores several topics in Cree morphology, syntax and discourse structure. Cree, an Algonquian language, is non-configurational: the grammatical relations of subject and object are not expressed by word order or other constituent structure relations, as they are in a configurational language like English. Instead, subjects and objects are expressed by means of the inflection on the verb. Cree is typical of non-configurational languages in allowing a great deal of word order variation. This study examines in detail aspects of the {P}lains {C}ree dialect, giving a valuable insight into the structure of this endangered language.},

abstract="This chapter touches upon several issues in the calculation and assessment of inter-annotator agreement. It gives an introduction to the theory behind agreement coefficients and examples of their application to linguistic annotation tasks. Specific examples explore variation in annotator performance due to heterogeneous data, complex labels, item difficulty, and annotator differences, showing how global agreement coefficients may mask these sources of variation, and how detailed agreement studies can give insight into both the annotation process and the nature of the underlying data. The chapter also reviews recent work on using machine learning to exploit the variation among annotators and learn detailed models from which accurate labels can be inferred. I therefore advocate an approach where agreement studies are not used merely as a means to accept or reject a particular annotation scheme, but as a tool for exploring patterns in the data that are being annotated.",

Abstract = {This paper presents a pilot study of the acoustic correlates of the {P}lains {C}ree vowel system. Naturalistic recordings of speakers of mid-20th-century {P}lains {C}ree, including one monolingual speaker, provide an empirical test for the general expectations from phonological descriptions. The results demonstrate that, while the hypothesized short/long vowel pairs do indeed have a strong durational contrast, the majority of vowel pairs are also distinguished by their formants. In all cases, the long vowel occupies a more extreme position in the vowel space. {P}lains {C}ree thus appears to show both a quantity and a quality contrast in its vowel pairs. The individual speaker data are then normalized to test whether there is intra-speaker variation in these results, with the results showing variation in the relation between vowels in all three parts of the vowel space.

Abstract = {A new contribution to linguistic theory, this book presents a formal framework for the analysis of word structure in human language. It sets forth the network of hypotheses constituting Paradigm Function Morphology, a theory of inflectional form whose central insight is that paradigms play an essential role in the definition of a language's system of word structure. The theory comprises several unprecedented claims, chief among which is the claim that a language's realization rules serve as clauses in the definition of a paradigm function, an overarching construct which is indispensable for capturing certain kinds of generalizations about inflectional form. This book differs from other recent works on the same subject in that it treats inflectional morphology as an autonomous system of principles rather than as a subsystem of syntax or phonology and it draws upon evidence from a diverse range of languages in motivating the proposed conception of word structure.},

We present a new, largely theory-independent CG framework and rule compiler (CG-3), that allows the linguist to write CG rules incorporating different types of linguistic information and methodology from a wide range of parsing approaches, covering not only CG’s native topological technique, but also dependency grammar, phrase structure grammar and unification grammar. In addition, we allow the integration of statistical-numerical constraints and non-discrete tag and string sets.}

  abstract={This paper is concerned with quantitative methods for the analysis of travel behaviour of individuals. It reviews some of the recent developments in model specification, estimation, model evaluation and testing, and aggregation and forecasting. Topics in model specification include the multinomial probit model and its computation, and generalized extreme value models and their relation to sequential models. Topics in estimation methods include the use of choice-based samples, sample designs, and incomplete choice sets. Model evaluation topics include prediction success tables and diagnostic tests of specification. Aggregation and forecasting topics include aggregation by the Clark method, synthesis of the distribution of explanatory variables, and the calculus of demand elasticities.},

 abstract = {For testing the equality of two independent binomial populations the Fisher exact test and the chi-squared test with Yates's continuity correction are often suggested for small and intermediate size samples. The use of these tests is inappropriate in that they are extremely conservative. In this article we demonstrate that, even for small samples, the uncorrected chi-squared test (i.e., the Pearson chi-squared test) and the two-independent-sample t test are robust in that their actual significance levels are us ually close to or smaller than the nominal levels. We encourage the use of these latter two tests.},
